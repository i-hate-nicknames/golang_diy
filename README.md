# golang_diy

This is a set of projects with automatic tests, each guiding user through implementing a basic version
of a particular idea, that usually is readily available as a library.
DIY (Do it Yourself) in this case stands for reinventing the wheel, for learning purposes.

## Routing

Routing system implementation, typically found in web application where it allows developers to hook
functions (handlers) to particular paths. These functions then will be called when a particular path
is accessed by users at runtime.

## Slice

Slice implementation that works the same way golang slices do, with syntactical differences.
